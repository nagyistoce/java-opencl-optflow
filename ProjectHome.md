A realtime GPU based implementation of the Lucas Kanade optical flow algorithm in Java and openCL.

Tested on GeForce GT540M. The demo only runs on windows, because DSCap is used for video capturing.



**Requirements:**
  1. An opencl compatible device (Only tested on NVidia devices)
  1. The openCL SDK (CUDA Toolkit for NVidia)
  1. JDK (Only tested on 32-bit platform)
